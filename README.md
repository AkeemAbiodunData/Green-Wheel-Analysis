# Green-Wheel-Analysis

## Project Overview

This project analyzes business performance for Green Wheel, focusing on key metrics such as customer demographics, vehicle types, and total cost of ownership. The analysis was conducted using Power BI, leveraging its data integration and visualization capabilities to create interactive dashboards and comprehensive insights.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis contains data from Green Wheel, including information on:

Sales transactions (product, quantity, and amount)

Revenue and profit metrics

Customer demographics (gender, location)

Vehicle types (Petrol, Diesel, Electric)

Cost of ownership metrics

Time-based data (daily, monthly, and yearly)

Data preprocessing involved data transformation using Power Query to clean and format the data. Measures and calculated columns were created in DAX to enhance analytical capabilities.

Analysis Techniques

## The analysis process involved the following steps:

## Data Cleaning and Transformation:

Used Power Query to clean data, remove duplicates, and format fields.

Created calculated columns and measures using DAX for accurate analysis.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Analyzed customer demographics, including gender distribution and location-based analysis.

Examined vehicle types to calculate the total cost of ownership for Petrol, Diesel, and Electric vehicles.

## Performance Analysis:

Evaluated cost of ownership across different vehicle types.

Analyzed the distribution of selling prices and maintenance costs by vehicle category.

Compared customer distribution by gender and location.

## Customer Segmentation:

Clustered customers based on location and vehicle preferences.

Analyzed high-value customer segments and their contribution to total ownership costs.

Interactive Dashboard Creation:

Developed interactive visualizations including pie charts, bar graphs, and donut charts.

Implemented drill-down functionality for detailed customer and vehicle analysis.

## Key Insights

The total cost of ownership amounts to 195.129M.

Petrol vehicles account for the highest cost of ownership (87.312M), followed by Diesel (58.711M) and Electric (49.106M).

The majority of customers are equally distributed between male and female (49% and 50% respectively).

Most customers are concentrated in key locations like Bristol, Cardiff, and London.

## Visualizations

The project includes interactive dashboards featuring visualizations that display KPIs, cost distribution, customer demographics, and vehicle performance. Screenshots of the KPIs and charts can be accessed here. These visuals allow stakeholders to explore data interactively and make data-driven decisions.
